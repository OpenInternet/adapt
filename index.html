                        The importance of strong data protection policies cannot be understated. In the absence of
                        strong, proactive legislation, internet users around the world remain vulnerable to intentional
                        attacks on their privacy and unintentional breaches that put them at risk.

                            (ADAPT) project is building a coordinated advocacy effort to promote rights-respecting
                            privacy policies and help internet users understand what protections currently exist to keep
                            their data, and themselves, safe online.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">Even in countries that have recently passed data protection legislation, it
                            is important
                            that individuals, private companies, and government have a strong understanding of how the
                            law will be enforced, who will provide oversight, and how it will impact everyday internet
                            users. ADAPT will regularly publish blog posts, podcasts, and other content that simplifies
                            and highlights each stage of the legislative lifecycle.

                    <p class="purple">ADAPT’s consortium partners are working on privacy advocacy and data protection
                        legislation in six countries in Africa and Latin America. Data protection regulations vary
                        widely across these countries, with some only just beginning to advocate around data rights
                        while other countries have drafted or passed legislation. As a result, ADAPT is identifying and
                        building strategies for each stage of the advocacy lifecycle, and working with consortium
                        partners to engage in collaboration and information sharing across countries and regions. Learn

                        <p>Bolivia does not have a personal data protection law, but its constitution does recognize the
                            right to privacy. The laws that currently exist governing issues of privacy and data
                            constitute a scattered and incomplete regulatory framework. A summary of the state of
                            privacy and personal data legislation in the country can be found here [Spanish]. Draft data
                            protection legislation has been introduced to the Bolivian lower chamber and is awaiting
                            further review and consultation.</p>

                        <p>The Brazilian General Data Protection Legislation (LGPD), drafted in 2018 and effective as of
                            February of 2020, is in its early stages of implementation. To oversee enforcement, Brazil’s
                            former president established the Data Protection Authority (DPA), tasked with
                            operationalizing the nascent legislation. In these early stages, advocacy efforts in the
                            country are focused on ensuring the DPA maintains consultation with civil society and human
                            rights groups in developing good guidelines and regulations, staffs its ranks with respected
                            experts, and establishes independence from the federal government as it begins enforcing
                            sanctions this year.</p>

                        <p>Ecuador currently has not formal data protection legislation. The constitution (article 66)
                            establishes recognizes the right to the protection of personal data but is not exhaustive
                            and is in need of updates. The President introduced a draft of the Law on Protection of
                            Personal Data which is currently being discussed in the national assembly. With elections
                            this year, momentum on this subject may be stalled if political priorities shift.</p>

                            public discourse in the country. Civil society efforts are currently focused on promoting

                        <p>In 2019 Kenyan lawmakers passed the Kenya Data Protection Act, a robust legal framework that
                            sought to modernize the countries legislation around the use of personal data. Other related
                            laws include the Data Protection Policy (2019), ICT Policy (2019) and a handful of older
                            legislation governing information, communications, and cybercrimes. Despite the country’s
                            relative success in passing data protection legislation, oversight and enforcement remain
                            weak, and a lack of funding and awareness have hindered implementation.</p>

                        <p>The Nigerian Data Protection Regulations (NDPR) was passed in 2019. Two additional bills (the
                            Data Protection Bill and the Digital Rights and Freedoms Bill) are currently being debated,
                            however, that would add to the landmark legislation. The concept of data protection is still
                            relatively new to Nigeria, though, and civil society efforts aim now to educate policymakers
                            and the public to help guide enforcement and implementation.</p>

                                    adequately funding regulatory bodies, human and technical constraints, inadequate
                                    infrastructure, and challenges with the cross-border nature of data protection
                                    regulations. ADAPT seeks to confront these challenges through nuanced advocacy and

                                    countries has led to a global call for ‘legal identity for all’ and the development
                                    and issuance of varied Digital ID schemes in developing countries. However, the
                                    implementation of such schemes has not been devoid of abuse, with discrimination
                                    putting at risk the lives and livelihoods of the very individuals it is intended to
                                    benefit. The ADAPT project seeks to address the role of data protection in
